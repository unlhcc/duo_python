# Overview

**duo_python** - Duo two-factor authentication for Python web applications

Duo provides simple two-factor authentication as a service via:

1.  Phone callback
2.  SMS-delivered one-time passcodes
3.  Duo mobile app to generate one-time passcodes
4.  Duo mobile app for smartphone push authentication
5.  Duo hardware token to generate one-time passcodes

This package allows a web developer to quickly add Duo's interactive, self-service, two-factor authentication to any web login form - without setting up secondary user accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.

What's here:

* `js` - Duo Javascript library, to be hosted by your webserver.
* `duo_web.py` - Duo Python SDK to be integrated with your web application
* `test.py` -  Unit tests for our SDK

# RPM build instructions
You must use the predefined spec file, not the one generated by distutils.
Build just the szip format, then create the SRPM and build the final RPM.
```
python setup.py sdist
mock --buildsrpm --spec duo-web-python.spec --sources dist --resultdir=dist
mock dist/duo-web-python-1.1-1.src.rpm --resultdir=dist
```
